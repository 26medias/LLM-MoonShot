[From: Professor Higgins]

I've reviewed your thesis, and I must be direct—it is far too short and lacks the depth expected at the PhD level. A dissertation should demonstrate comprehensive research, critical analysis, and significant contributions to the field. Right now, it falls short of these expectations.  

### Areas that require immediate expansion:  

1. **Literature Review** – Your engagement with existing research is minimal. This section needs a much more thorough review of relevant studies, identifying gaps and positioning your work within the academic conversation.  

2. **Methodology** – The methodology is too vague. It should be detailed enough that another researcher could replicate your study. Right now, it lacks the necessary depth and justification of methods.  

3. **Analysis and Discussion** – The results are presented but not sufficiently analyzed. This section needs a much deeper discussion of the implications of your findings, comparing them with existing research and addressing potential limitations.  

4. **Contributions and Implications** – A PhD thesis must clearly articulate its contribution to the field. What new knowledge does your research provide? This should be explicitly stated and well-supported by your findings.  

At this stage, your thesis reads more like an extended research paper than a doctoral dissertation. It needs substantial expansion in both length and depth. You must revise and significantly develop these sections immediately.  

I expect your final draft (in markdown format), fully addressing all these issues, as soon as possible in your next reply.
